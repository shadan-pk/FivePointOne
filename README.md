**FivePointOne** is my new project idea — an Android app that turns multiple phones and Bluetooth speakers into a synchronized 5.1 surround sound system over a local Wi-Fi network.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🎯 Goal: Create a surround sound experience using Android phones and Bluetooth speakers.
- 📱 Platform: Android (initial release)
- 🌐 Connectivity: Local Wi-Fi (LAN) for device communication
- 🔈 Output: Each device acts as a speaker for one audio channel (e.g., front left, rear right)

## ⚙️ Features (Planned)

- Assign audio channels to devices
- Low-latency audio and video playback
- Sync over local network
- Support for Bluetooth speakers
- Cross-device playback coordination

## 🚧 Status

- Main device now listens for speaker broadcasts and lists available speakers dynamically.  
- UI updated to reflect real-time discovery of speaker devices.  
- Created Screen for each speaker conencted in main device
